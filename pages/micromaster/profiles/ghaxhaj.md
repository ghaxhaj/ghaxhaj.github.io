## ***Description***
Hi! My name is Granit and I am a software engineer. My skills include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, 
Vanilla Javascript, React.js, React Native, p5.js, Bootstrap, CSS, R, Python, and building full CRUD applications. 
I have experience in game design, social media apps, and music playlist creation.

In addition to earning a bachelorâ€™s in economics from Fordham University in May 2019, 
I worked in the intellectual properties department at a law firm, mainly conducting research 
related to patent protection. Working as an internet researcher helped me develop quality research 
and data management skills. It gave me practice with thinking outside the box. This means that when I look at 
a problem, I find abstract solutions that most cannot see to solve the problem.
